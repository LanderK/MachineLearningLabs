    "Below a set of variables to represent conditional probability distributions have been defined. They are a Bernoulli trial for each combination of conditional variables, given as $P(\\texttt{False}|...)$ in `[0,...]` and $P(\\texttt{True}|...)$ in `[1,...]` (It may be easier to think of them as boring categorical distributions).\n",

You must then normalise them so that the sum over axis 0 is always 1. There is an extra mark for doing the right thing and including a prior. You may want to know that the conjugate prior to the Bernoulli trial represented as $\\left[P(\\texttt{False}), P(\\texttt{True})\\right]$ is a Dirichlet distribution; a uniform prior would be a reasonable choice (it can be argued that the expected failure probability is low, and you should adjust the first 7 variables accordingly, but given the quantity of data available it's not going to matter).\n",

    " * It is strongly suggested to use the same calling convention as `brute_marginals` above for your final interface.\n",
    " * The order of the variables above is such that each variable is dependent only on variables that occur before it. Depending on your approach this information may save you some effort.\n",
    " * You will want to add code before the function to prepare. This might involve creating Factor and Node classes. Or a list of edges in the graphical model, in the order they need to be processed. Choose whatever you are comfortable with, but spend time thinking it through first. If you get it wrong your code will get messy!\n",
    " * This problem is small enough that you can brute force it - code to do so has been provided above. Do test that your implementation is correct by comparing them!\n",

    "Bayesian decision theory sounds fancy, but is actually really simple. All you do is use Bayesian reasoning and a cost function to select the decision that, with everything integrated out, minimises the expected cost. In practise various approximations are usually made - here for instance we are using the mean model parameters instead of properly integrating them out; for a model such as this that is reasonable. Note that it isn't actually Bayesian unless you introduced a prior above!\n",

    "Your task is to generate a flow chart indicating how a mechanic is to diagnose a problem with a coffee machine.\n",
    "Here is an example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart#/media/File:LampFlowchart.svg Output it below the code block; don't worry about making it pretty but if your output is particularly hard to read feel free to copy & paste it into a markdown block and neaten it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a machine to be diagnosed when confidence that one of the problems is in the broken state exceeds 90%. You can take multiple approaches to solving this problem, but the recommended technique:\n",
    " * Write a function to detect if a coffee machine is reliably diagnosed, given a dictionary of observed variables.\n",
    " * Write a recursive search function that takes a dictionary of observed variables. It will return a tree that includes the diagnostic variable to observe at each node and how long on average it takes to diagnose from that point in the tree.\n",
    " * Call the recursive search function with no observed variables and print out the tree it returns.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that this is very similar to constructing a random forest, but with a different objective, and instead of looping splits you loop unobserved diagnostic random variables. Remember to weight the machines by the probability of their defect occurring, which you learnt in step 1. Make sure you handle all observations being made and no defect being found (Don't delete these scenarios, as they do occur in real life; instead make sure that if everything is observed the defect is considered to have been found, even though the defect is probably with the user.).\n",
